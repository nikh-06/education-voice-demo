# The Role of Microorganisms in Plant Nutrition

### Part 1 (5th Grade Level)

1.  According to the text, where do some microorganisms live on leguminous plants?
2.  What do microorganisms like bacteria and fungi do to dead plants and animals in the soil?

### Part 2 (8th Grade Level)

1.  Explain why atmospheric nitrogen is not directly available to plants and describe the process by which microorganisms make it available.
2.  The text describes two different roles that bacteria play regarding nitrogen in the soil. Describe how one group of bacteria increases soil fertility and how another group decreases it.
3.  Based on the provided information, explain how the actions of different microorganisms help keep the percentage of nitrogen in the atmosphere "more or less constant."

### Answer Key

**Part 1 Answers:**

1.  Some microorganisms live in the root nodules of leguminous plants.
2.  They decompose dead plants and animals into simple substances or nitrogenous compounds that can be used by plants again.

**Part 2 Answers:**

1.  Atmospheric nitrogen cannot be taken directly by plants. Certain bacteria and blue-green algae in the soil fix the nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into usable compounds of nitrogen, which plants can then utilize from the soil through their root system.
2.  One group of bacteria (like *Rhizobium* in root nodules or others in the soil) increases soil fertility by fixing nitrogen from the air and converting it into nitrogenous compounds. Another group of bacteria decreases available nitrogen by converting compounds of nitrogen present in the soil back into nitrogen gas, which is then released into the atmosphere.
3.  Microorganisms keep the amount of nitrogen in the atmosphere constant through the nitrogen cycle. Some bacteria and blue-green algae take nitrogen gas from the atmosphere and convert it into compounds in the soil (nitrogen fixation). Conversely, other bacteria convert nitrogenous compounds from dead organisms back into nitrogen gas, which returns to the atmosphere. This balance of removal and release keeps the atmospheric percentage of nitrogen stable.
