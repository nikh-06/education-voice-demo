### **Worksheet: Microorganisms and Plant Nutrition**

**Instructions:** Read the provided facts carefully. Use ONLY the information from the text to answer the following questions in complete sentences.

**1.** According to the text, why do plants need microorganisms to help them get nitrogen, even though nitrogen gas is abundant in the atmosphere?

**2.** The text describes two main locations where bacteria help make nitrogen usable for plants. What are these two locations?

**3.** Besides taking nitrogen from the atmosphere, what is another way microorganisms make nitrogen compounds available in the soil for plants to use?

**4.** Once a plant absorbs usable nitrogen compounds through its roots, what does it use the nitrogen for?

### **Answer Key**

**1.** According to the text, nitrogen cannot be taken directly by plants from the atmosphere. Microorganisms must first convert it into usable compounds.

**2.** The two locations are:
    *   In the root nodules of leguminous plants.
    *   In the soil.

**3.** Microorganisms decompose dead plants and animals, which converts their nitrogenous wastes back into nitrogenous compounds that other plants can use.

**4.** The plant uses the nitrogen for the synthesis of plant proteins and other compounds.
