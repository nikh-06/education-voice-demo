### **Lesson Plan**

**1. Topic**
The Role of Microorganisms in Plant Nutrition

**2. Target Grades**
5th and 8th Grade (with differentiated activities)

**3. Objectives**
Upon completion of this lesson, students will be able to:
*   Explain why plants require microorganisms to utilize atmospheric nitrogen.
*   Identify the two primary processes by which microorganisms make nitrogen available to plants: nitrogen fixation and decomposition.
*   Describe the specific role of microorganisms found in the root nodules of leguminous plants.
*   Illustrate the basic flow of nitrogen between the atmosphere, soil, and living organisms, identifying the function of bacteria and fungi.

**4. Materials**
*   Whiteboard or chalkboard
*   Markers or chalk
*   Paper for drawing and note-taking
*   Colored pencils or crayons
*   Reproductions or drawings of "Roots of a leguminous plant with root nodules" (Fig. 2.9) and "Nitrogen cycle" (Fig. 2.10) from the source material.

### **Lesson Procedure**

**5. Introduction (5 minutes)**

*   **Teacher Presentation:** The instructor will present the following analogy: "Microorganisms are like a mother who grinds hard spices into a fine powder before adding them to a curry."
*   **Guided Discussion:** The instructor will ask students to interpret the analogy. Guide the discussion toward the central concept: "Just as the whole spices cannot flavour the dish, plants cannot absorb large, complex materials in the soil until microorganisms break them down into simple, usable nutrients."
*   **Topic Connection:** The instructor will state that the lesson focuses on how microorganisms help plants acquire a critical nutrient, nitrogen, which plants cannot use directly from the air.

**6. Activities (25 minutes)**

**Activity 1: The Nitrogen Problem & The Microbial Solution (10 minutes)**

*   **Direct Instruction:** Explain that nitrogen is a vital component for the synthesis of plant proteins. However, plants cannot absorb the nitrogen gas that is abundant in the atmosphere.
*   **Introducing "Fixation":** Introduce the term "nitrogen fixation." Explain that this is the process of converting nitrogen from the atmosphere into compounds that plants can use.
*   **Identifying the "Fixers":** Based on the source material, identify the microorganisms responsible:
    1.  Certain bacteria and blue-green algae present in the soil.
    2.  Specific microorganisms (bacteria) that reside in the root nodules of leguminous plants.
*   **Visual Aid:** Display or draw the image of root nodules on a leguminous plant. Explain that this is a special relationship where the microorganisms fix nitrogen, which increases soil fertility.

**Activity 2: The Recyclers - Decomposition (5 minutes)**

*   **Direct Instruction:** Explain that another group of microorganisms, bacteria and fungi, act as decomposers.
*   **Process Description:** When plants and animals die, these microorganisms break down the dead organic waste. This process converts the nitrogenous wastes back into simple nitrogenous compounds in the soil, which can then be used again by living plants. This also serves to clean up the environment.

**Activity 3: Diagramming the Nitrogen Flow (10 minutes)**

*   **Task:** Students will create a diagram illustrating the roles of microorganisms in providing nitrogen to plants.

*   **Differentiation:**
    *   **For 5th Grade:** Students will create a simple flow chart with two main paths.
        1.  **Fixation:** Air Nitrogen → Microorganism in Soil/Root → Usable Nitrogen for Plant.
        2.  **Decomposition:** Dead Plant → Bacteria/Fungi → Usable Nitrogen for New Plant.
        *Focus on the concept of "helpers" that prepare food for plants.*

    *   **For 8th Grade:** Students will draw a more detailed cycle based on the source material's "Nitrogen cycle" diagram. The diagram must include:
        1.  **Nitrogen Fixation:** by bacteria and blue-green algae in the soil and bacteria in root nodules of leguminous plants.
        2.  **Assimilation:** Plants absorb nitrogenous compounds through their roots. Animals eat plants to get nitrogen compounds.
        3.  **Decomposition:** Bacteria and fungi convert nitrogenous waste from dead organisms back into usable compounds for plants.
        4.  **Denitrification:** Certain bacteria convert some nitrogen compounds back into nitrogen gas, which is released into the atmosphere.
        *Focus on the cyclical nature of the process and the specific transformations.*

**7. Assessment (5-10 minutes)**

*   **Exit Ticket:** Students will answer the following questions on a small slip of paper. Questions will be differentiated by grade level.

*   **5th Grade Questions:**
    1.  Can plants use nitrogen directly from the air? (Yes/No)
    2.  List two ways microorganisms help plants get the nitrogen they need.
        *(Expected Answer: 1. They take it from the air and put it in the soil. 2. They break down dead plants and animals.)*

*   **8th Grade Questions:**
    1.  Explain the process of nitrogen fixation and identify two types of microorganisms that carry it out.
        *(Expected Answer: It is the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into usable nitrogen compounds by certain bacteria and blue-green algae.)*
    2.  What is the role of bacteria and fungi as decomposers in the nitrogen cycle?
        *(Expected Answer: They convert nitrogenous wastes from dead plants and animals into nitrogenous compounds that can be used by plants again.)*
    3.  According to the source material, how is nitrogen gas returned to the atmosphere from the soil?
        *(Expected Answer: Certain bacteria convert compounds of nitrogen present in the soil into nitrogen gas.)*
