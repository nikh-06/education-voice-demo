### **Part 2 (Suggested for 8th Grade)**

*Instructions: Answer the following questions using only the information from the provided text.*

1.  Plants cannot use nitrogen directly from the air. Describe the process that allows nitrogen from the atmosphere to be used by plants for synthesizing proteins and other compounds.
2.  After a plant or animal dies, the text describes two different roles bacteria can play regarding the nitrogen in the dead organism. What are these two different roles?
3.  The text states that the percentage of nitrogen in the atmosphere remains "more or less constant." Explain how the different actions of microorganisms described in the text contribute to this balance.

### **Answer Key**

**Part 1**
1.  They live in the root nodules of leguminous plants.
2.  They fix nitrogen from the air into the soil, OR they decompose organic waste and dead plants and animals into simple substances.

**Part 2**
1.  Certain bacteria and blue-green algae present in the soil fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into usable compounds of nitrogen. Plants can then utilize these compounds by absorbing them from the soil through their root system.
2.  The first role is that some bacteria and fungi convert the nitrogenous wastes from dead organisms into nitrogenous compounds that can be used by plants again. The second role is that certain other bacteria convert some of these compounds back into nitrogen gas, which is released into the atmosphere.
3.  The amount of nitrogen in the atmosphere stays constant because there is a cycle. Some bacteria and blue-green algae take nitrogen gas from the atmosphere and "fix" it into the soil for plants to use. At the same time, other bacteria convert nitrogen compounds in the soil back into nitrogen gas, which is released back into the atmosphere. This creates a balance.
