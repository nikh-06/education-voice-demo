This worksheet is based strictly on the provided source material.

---

### **Part 1 (Suggested for 5th Grade)**

*Answer the following questions using only the information from the provided text.*

1.  According to the text, what do some bacteria in the soil do to nitrogen from the air to make the soil more fertile?
2.  The text states that some helpful microorganisms live in the root nodules of what specific type of plants?

### **Part 2 (Suggested for 8th Grade)**

*Answer the following questions by synthesizing information from across the provided source material.*

1.  Based on the text, describe the journey of nitrogen from the atmosphere into a plant. Mention the role of microorganisms and how the plant absorbs the final product.
2.  The text describes bacteria that increase usable nitrogen in the soil and other bacteria that do the opposite. Explain these two opposing processes as described in the source material.
3.  Explain two different ways microorganisms contribute to plant nutrition as mentioned in the text. Identify the types of microorganisms involved in each process if the text specifies them.

### **Answer Key**

**Part 1 Answers:**

1.  They fix nitrogen from the air/atmosphere and convert it into nitrogenous compounds, which increases soil fertility.
2.  Leguminous plants.

**Part 2 Answers:**

1.  Certain bacteria and blue-green algae present in the soil fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into usable compounds of nitrogen. Plants then utilize these compounds from the soil through their root system.
2.  One process is nitrogen fixation, where certain bacteria take nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into nitrogenous compounds in the soil. The opposing process involves other bacteria converting nitrogen compounds already in the soil back into nitrogen gas, which is then released into the atmosphere.
3.  
    *   **1. Nitrogen Fixation:** Certain bacteria (such as *Rhizobium* in the root nodules of leguminous plants) and blue-green algae fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, converting it into compounds of nitrogen that plants can use.
    *   **2. Decomposition:** When plants and animals die, bacteria and fungi present in the soil decompose the organic waste. They convert the nitrogenous wastes into nitrogenous compounds that can be used by plants again.
