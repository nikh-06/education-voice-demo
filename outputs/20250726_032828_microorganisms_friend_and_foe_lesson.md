### **Lesson Plan: Microorganisms: Friend and Foe**

---

#### **1. Topic**
Microorganisms: Friend and Foe

---

#### **2. Target Audience**
Grades 5 and 8.
*(Note: This lesson is designed with a core structure for both grades, with specific differentiation points to challenge 8th-grade students with more complex concepts available in the source text.)*

---

#### **3. Learning Objectives**
By the end of this 45-minute lesson, students will be able to:
*   Define what a microorganism is, based on the provided text.
*   List at least three different environments where microorganisms can live.
*   Identify the main types of microorganisms mentioned in the text (bacteria, fungi, protozoa, algae, and viruses).
*   Explain the "Friend and Foe" concept using the provided "neighbours in a colony" analogy.
*   Provide at least two examples of "friendly" microorganisms and one example of a "foe" microorganism from the text.
*   **(For 8th Grade):** Differentiate between viruses and other microorganisms based on their method of reproduction.

---

#### **4. Materials**
*   Photocopies of the provided source material for student reference.
*   Whiteboard or chalkboard and markers/chalk.
*   A magnifying glass and one slice of moist bread (kept in a sealed bag for a day or two prior to the lesson to show spoilage).
*   Chart paper and markers for a group activity.
*   A small container of curd (yoghurt) as a visual aid.
*   Student worksheets for assessment (see section 7).

#### **5. Introduction (10 minutes)**

**Teacher:** "Good morning, class. Today, we're going to talk about neighbours. Imagine the colony or building you live in. You probably have some very helpful neighbours who might share things or help you out. But you might also have some troublesome neighbours who create problems. Our world is full of another kind of neighbour, so small we can't even see them. These are **microorganisms**."

**(Teacher writes "Microorganisms" on the board.)**

**Teacher:** "Just like the neighbours in our colony, some of these microorganisms are helpful friends, and others are troublesome foes. For example, have you ever seen what happens to a moist piece of bread left out for a few days?"

**(Teacher carefully shows the class the slice of spoiled bread through the bag. Passes around the magnifying glass for students to observe the "greyish white patches" and "tiny, black rounded structures" as described on Page 16.)**

**Teacher:** "What you are seeing are a type of microorganism. The text tells us these are tiny living organisms that we normally cannot see without help, like a magnifying glass or a microscope. Today, we will explore their world and find out who are our friends and who are our foes."

#### **6. Activities (25 minutes)**

**Activity 1: The Invisible World - Where Do They Live? (10 mins)**

1.  **Defining and Categorizing:**
    *   The teacher will ask students to look at their source text (Page 27) and identify the main types of microorganisms.
    *   **Teacher:** "The text lists several types. What are they?" (Guide students to find: **bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and some algae**).
    *   **Teacher:** "It also mentions one more that is a bit different. What is it?" (Guide them to find **Viruses**).
    *   The teacher lists these on the board.

2.  **Extreme Survivors:**
    *   **Teacher:** "Now, where do you think these tiny neighbours live? Look at Page 18 and Page 30."
    *   Students read the sections. The teacher asks for volunteers to share the different environments.
    *   List on the board:
        *   Ice cold climate
        *   Hot springs
        *   Deserts
        *   Marshy lands
        *   Inside bodies of animals/humans
        *   **Extreme Examples (from Page 30):** Boiling mudpots, icy waters, lakes of caustic soda, pools of concentrated sulphuric acid, and even on a camera left on the moon!
    *   **Teacher:** "So, the text says there is probably *no environment* in which bacteria cannot survive. They are some of the toughest neighbours on Earth!"

**Activity 2: Group Work - Helpful Friends vs. Troublesome Foes (15 mins)**

1.  **Set-up:** Divide the class into two large teams: "Team Friend" and "Team Foe." Give each team a large sheet of chart paper.

2.  **The Task:**
    *   **Teacher:** "Using our 'neighbour' analogy, your team's job is to create a profile of your type of microorganism based *only* on the provided text. What do they do? What are some examples?"
    *   **Team Friend's Mission:** Find all the helpful things microorganisms do. (Source: Page 18).
        *   *Expected findings:* Used in preparing curd, bread, and cake. The bacterium *Lactobacillus* promotes curd formation. Used for the production of alcohol and medicines.
    *   **Team Foe's Mission:** Find all the harmful things microorganisms do. (Source: Pages 16 & 18).
        *   *Expected findings:* They are harmful and cause diseases. They spoil moist bread.

3.  **Presentations:** Each team presents its chart to the class. The teacher can hold up the container of curd when Team Friend mentions *Lactobacillus*.

4.  **Differentiation for 8th Grade (within the activity):**
    *   Challenge 8th-grade students to find the specific keywords from Page 27 that relate to their team.
    *   **Team Friend:** *Lactobacillus, Fermentation, Yeast, Antibiotics*
    *   **Team Foe:** *Pathogen, Communicable Diseases*
    *   **Teacher:** "8th graders, I want you to also pay attention to the special case of Viruses on page 27. The text says they are 'quite different' from other microorganisms. Why?" (Lead them to the fact that viruses reproduce *only inside the host organism*). This can be a short discussion after the presentations.

#### **7. Assessment (10 minutes)**

Distribute the following worksheet. All answers must be found within the provided source text.

**Worksheet: Our Microscopic Neighbours**

**Name:** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Grade:** \_\_\_\_\_

**Part 1: Fill in the Blanks**

1.  Living organisms that are too small to be seen with the unaided eye are called __________________. (microorganisms)
2.  The bacterium named __________________ multiplies in milk to promote the formation of curd. (*Lactobacillus*)
3.  Microorganisms can be found in extreme environments like hot springs and __________________ lands. (marshy)
4.  The spoilage of moist bread, which gets covered in greyish white patches, is caused by a type of microorganism. (True/False - **True**)

**Part 2: Short Answer**

5.  List three types of microorganisms mentioned in the text.
    *(Answer should include three from: bacteria, fungi, protozoa, algae, viruses)*

6.  Using the "neighbours in a colony" analogy, explain the difference between a "friend" and a "foe" microorganism. Give one example of each from the text.
    *(A "friend" is a helpful neighbour, like the Lactobacillus bacteria that helps make curd. A "foe" is a troublesome neighbour, like the microorganisms that cause diseases.)*

**Part 3: Challenge Question (for 8th Grade)**

7.  According to the text, what makes viruses "quite different" from other microorganisms like bacteria?
    *(Answer: Viruses are different because they can reproduce only inside the host organism/cell.)*
