#### **Part 2 (8th Grade Level)**

3.  The text states that nitrogen is an essential part of chlorophyll. Explain the specific role that bacteria and blue-green algae play in making this essential element available for plants to use.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
4.  Using information from the text and image captions, describe the special relationship between "leguminous plants" and *Rhizobium* bacteria, and explain how this benefits the plant.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
5.  The text states that the percentage of nitrogen in the atmosphere "remains more or less constant." Based on the source, describe the complete cycle, explaining how nitrogen is both removed from and returned to the atmosphere by different types of bacteria.
    <br>

### **Answer Key**

1.  Nitrogen is an essential part of **proteins, chlorophyll, nucleic acids, and vitamins.**
2.  Plants get usable nitrogen compounds from the soil **through their root system.**
3.  Certain bacteria and blue-green algae in the soil **fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into compounds of nitrogen** that plants can then utilize.
4.  *Rhizobium* bacteria are present in the **nodules on the roots of leguminous plants.** These bacteria **fix atmospheric nitrogen**, which provides the plant with the essential nutrient.
5.  Nitrogen is removed from the atmosphere by **certain bacteria and blue-green algae** that "fix" it into usable compounds for plants. It is returned to the atmosphere when, after plants and animals die, **"certain other bacteria" convert some of the nitrogenous compounds back into nitrogen gas.**
