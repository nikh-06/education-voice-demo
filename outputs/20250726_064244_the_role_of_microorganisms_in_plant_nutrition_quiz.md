# The Role of Microorganisms in Plant Nutrition

### Questions

1.  Explain why plants cannot use nitrogen directly from the atmosphere. How do microorganisms help plants obtain usable nitrogen?

2.  What is the function of the microorganisms that live in the root nodules of leguminous plants? Name the specific bacterium mentioned in the text that performs this role.

3.  The text describes two opposite roles that different bacteria play in the nitrogen cycle. What are these two roles?

### Answer Key

1.  Plants cannot take nitrogen directly from the atmosphere. Certain bacteria and blue-green algae in the soil fix atmospheric nitrogen and convert it into usable compounds, which plants can then absorb from the soil through their roots.

2.  The microorganisms in the root nodules of leguminous plants fix nitrogen from the air into the soil, which increases soil fertility. The bacterium named in the text is *Rhizobium*.

3.  One role is fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere into nitrogenous compounds in the soil for plants to use. The other role is converting nitrogen compounds present in the soil back into nitrogen gas, which is released into the atmosphere.
