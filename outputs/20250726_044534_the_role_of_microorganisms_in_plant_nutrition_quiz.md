### Part 2 (8th Grade Level)

*Instructions: Answer the following questions using the provided source material.*

1.  Describe the process by which nitrogen from the atmosphere becomes usable by plants and is then transferred to animals.
2.  According to the text, microorganisms play two key roles in making nitrogen compounds available in the soil for plants to use again. What are these two roles?
3.  The text states that the percentage of nitrogen in the atmosphere remains "more or less constant." Explain how the actions of two different types of bacteria contribute to this balance.

### Answer Key

**Part 1 Answers:**

1.  They live in the root nodules of leguminous plants.
2.  They decompose them into simple substances.

**Part 2 Answers:**

1.  Certain bacteria and blue-green algae fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into usable compounds. Plants utilize these compounds from the soil through their root system to synthesize plant proteins. Animals then get these nitrogen compounds by feeding on the plants.
2.  The two roles are:
    *   Fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere and converting it into nitrogenous compounds.
    *   Decomposing nitrogenous wastes from dead plants and animals into nitrogenous compounds.
3.  One group of bacteria and blue-green algae fixes nitrogen from the atmosphere and converts it into compounds in the soil. In opposition, certain other bacteria convert nitrogen compounds present in the soil back into nitrogen gas, which is released into the atmosphere. This cycle keeps the amount of nitrogen in the atmosphere relatively constant.
