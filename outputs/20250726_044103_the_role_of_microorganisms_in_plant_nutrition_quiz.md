# The Role of Microorganisms in Plant Nutrition Worksheet

### Part 1 (Suggested for 5th Grade)

1.  In what part of leguminous plants do some nitrogen-fixing microorganisms live?
2.  What do some microorganisms do to dead plants and animals that helps clean up the environment?

### Part 2 (Suggested for 8th Grade)

1.  Explain why plants cannot use nitrogen directly from the atmosphere and describe the process by which microorganisms make it available to them.
2.  When plants and animals die, describe the role that bacteria and fungi play in recycling nitrogenous wastes.
3.  The texts describe two distinct functions of different bacteria that affect the amount of nitrogen in the atmosphere. Describe both of these opposing functions.

### Answer Key

**Part 1**
1.  They live in the root nodules of leguminous plants.
2.  They decompose the organic waste and dead plants and animals into simple substances.

**Part 2**
1.  Nitrogen from the atmosphere cannot be taken directly by plants. Certain bacteria and blue-green algae in the soil fix the nitrogen, converting it into usable compounds of nitrogen. Plants can then utilize these compounds from the soil through their root system.
2.  When plants and animals die, bacteria and fungi present in the soil convert the nitrogenous wastes into nitrogenous compounds that can be used by plants again.
3.  One function is nitrogen fixation, where certain bacteria convert nitrogen from the atmosphere into nitrogenous compounds in the soil, increasing soil fertility. The opposing function is performed by other bacteria that convert compounds of nitrogen present in the soil into nitrogen gas, which is released back into the atmosphere.
