# The Role of Microorganisms in Plant Nutrition

### Part 1 (5th Grade)

1.  What do some microorganisms that live in the root nodules of leguminous plants do to help the soil?
2.  According to the text, where are *Rhizobium* bacteria found?

### Part 2 (8th Grade)

1.  Explain the process by which nitrogen from the atmosphere, which cannot be used directly by plants, is made available for them to use. Mention the two types of microorganisms involved.
2.  Based on the text, describe two opposite roles that different bacteria play regarding the amount of usable nitrogen in the soil.
3.  After plants and animals die, what two roles do microorganisms play in continuing the nitrogen cycle?

### Answer Key

**Part 1 Answers**

1.  They fix nitrogen from the air into the soil and increase soil fertility.
2.  They are found in the nodules of roots of leguminous plants.

**Part 2 Answers**

1.  Certain bacteria and blue-green algae in the soil, along with microorganisms in the root nodules of leguminous plants, fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into usable nitrogenous compounds. Plants can then absorb these compounds from the soil through their roots.
2.  Some bacteria present in the soil fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into nitrogenous compounds, increasing the nitrogen available to plants. In contrast, certain other bacteria convert nitrogen compounds already in the soil back into nitrogen gas, which is released into the atmosphere, reducing the amount of usable nitrogen in the soil.
3.  First, bacteria and fungi in the soil decompose the dead plants and animals, converting their nitrogenous wastes back into nitrogenous compounds that can be used by new plants. Second, certain other bacteria convert some of these compounds back into nitrogen gas, which returns to the atmosphere.
