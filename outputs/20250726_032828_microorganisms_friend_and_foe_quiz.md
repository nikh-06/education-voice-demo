#### **Part 1 (Suggested for 5th Grade)**

**1.** According to the text, name two food items that are prepared using microorganisms.
<br>
<br>

**2.** The source material describes bacteria as "hardy organisms." List two extreme environments where they have been found living.
<br>
<br>

#### **Part 2 (Suggested for 8th Grade)**

**3.** Based on the information on page 27, what makes viruses "quite different" from other microorganisms like bacteria?
<br>
<br>

**4.** The text on page 30 states that bacteria can "probably... survive in space." What specific piece of evidence does the author provide to support this claim?
<br>
<br>

**5.** The author concludes on page 30, "There is probably no environment in which bacteria cannot survive." Using information from at least **two different pages** of the source material, explain how the text supports this broad conclusion.

### **Answer Key**

**Part 1**
1.  Any two of the following: curd, bread, cake. (Source: Page 18)
2.  Any two of the following: boiling mudpots, extremely cold icy waters, lakes of caustic soda, pools of concentrated sulphuric acid, depths of several kilometres, or space (on a camera that was on the moon). (Source: Page 30)

**Part 2**
3.  Viruses are different because they can reproduce only inside a host organism (like a bacterium, plant, or animal cell). (Source: Page 27)
4.  The evidence provided is that a type of bacterium was recovered from a camera that had been on the moon for two years. (Source: Page 30)
5.  The text supports this conclusion by combining general statements with specific, extreme examples. **Page 18** states that microorganisms live in all environments, from "ice cold climate to hot springs; and deserts to marshy lands" and even inside animals. **Page 30** provides extreme examples of this, mentioning bacteria have been found in "boiling mudpots," "pools of concentrated sulphuric acid," and even on a camera left on the moon. Together, these sources show the vast and extreme range of environments where microorganisms can live.
