### **Lesson Procedure**

#### **1. Introduction (5 minutes)**

**Hook:** Start by asking the class, "We know plants need sunlight and water, but what do they get from the soil? Do they just eat dirt?" Allow a few brief answers.

**Introduce the Analogy:**
"That's a great starting point. But there's a problem. Many of the most important nutrients in the soil and air are in a form that plants can't use directly. It's like having a pantry full of raw flour, eggs, and sugar. You can't just eat those ingredients. You need a chef to turn them into a cake you can eat."

"Today, we're going to learn about the 'tiny chefs' for plants. **Microorganisms act like tiny chefs for the plant in the soil. They take raw nutrients that the plant cannot use and 'cook' them into a simple, nourishing meal that the roots can easily absorb.**"

Write the analogy on the board and keep it visible throughout the lesson.

#### **2. Activity 1: The Chefs' Menus - Nitrogen Fixation and Decomposition (15 minutes)**

**Part A: The Problem with Nitrogen (Teacher-led Explanation)**
1.  Explain to students that the most important "raw ingredient" for plants is a gas called nitrogen. Our atmosphere is full of it.
2.  State the key problem, using the provided text: "**Nitrogen cannot be taken directly by plants and animals.**"
3.  Explain that the plant's "tiny chefs"—microorganisms—have two main ways, or two "recipes," to prepare this nitrogen meal.

**Part B: Recipe #1 - Fixing Nitrogen from the Air (Group Work)**
1.  Direct students to the provided facts. Ask them to find all the sentences that describe how microorganisms get nitrogen from the air and put it into the soil.
2.  Have students share their findings. Write the key facts on the board under the heading "**Recipe 1: Nitrogen Fixation**".
    *   Fact: "**Certain bacteria and blue green algae present in the soil fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into compounds of nitrogen.**"
    *   Fact: "**Some microorganisms reside in the root nodules of leguminous plants. They can fix nitrogen from air into soil and increase the soil fertility.**" (Mention the specific bacterium, *Rhizobium*, as noted in the facts).
3.  Explain that "fixing" nitrogen is the "cooking" process that turns unusable gas into usable compounds for the plant. Emphasize that this increases soil fertility.

**Part C: Recipe #2 - Recycling Nutrients (Teacher-led Discussion)**
1.  Ask the students: "What happens to the nitrogen in a plant or an animal after it dies?"
2.  Guide them to the relevant fact: "**When plants and animals die, bacteria and fungi present in the soil convert the nitrogenous wastes into nitrogenous compounds to be used by plants again.**"
3.  Write this on the board under the heading "**Recipe 2: Decomposition (Recycling)**".
4.  Connect this to another fact: "**Some microorganisms decompose the organic waste and dead plants and animals into simple substances and clean up the environment.**" Explain that this "cleaning up" is actually recycling nutrients for new plants.

#### **3. Activity 2: The Big Picture - A Simple Nitrogen Cycle (15 minutes)**

1.  Tell students that these "recipes" are part of a giant, continuous cycle. We will draw a simplified version based *only* on our facts.
2.  Draw the following flowchart on the board, asking students for the information to fill in the boxes and label the arrows based on the facts they just learned.

    **(Box 1: Nitrogen in Atmosphere)**
    ↓  *Arrow labeled: "Fixed by bacteria and blue-green algae in soil"*
    **(Box 2: Usable Nitrogen Compounds in Soil)**
    ↓  *Arrow labeled: "Utilised by plants from the soil through their root system"*
    **(Box 3: Plants (Plant proteins and other compounds))**
    ↓  *Arrow labeled: "Animals feeding on plants get these... compounds"*
    **(Box 4: Animals)**

3.  Now, draw arrows from both "Plants" and "Animals" pointing back to "Usable Nitrogen Compounds in Soil".
    *   Label these arrows: "**When plants and animals die, bacteria and fungi convert the nitrogenous wastes into nitrogenous compounds.**"

4.  Finally, introduce the last step. Ask students to find the fact about what *some other* bacteria do.
    *   Guide them to: "**Certain other bacteria convert some part of them [nitrogen compounds] to nitrogen gas which goes back into the atmosphere.**"
    *   Draw one final arrow from "Usable Nitrogen Compounds in Soil" back up to "Nitrogen in Atmosphere" and label it with this fact.

5.  Conclude by stating: "As a result, the percentage of nitrogen in the atmosphere remains more or less constant."

### **Assessment (10 minutes)**

**1. Quick Oral Quiz:**
*   In our analogy, what do the "tiny chefs" represent? (*Microorganisms*)
*   What is the "raw ingredient" they cook with? (*Atmospheric nitrogen or dead organic waste*)
*   What is the "nourishing meal" they prepare for the plants? (*Usable nitrogen compounds*)
*   Name one place where special nitrogen-fixing bacteria live. (*In the soil, or in the root nodules of leguminous plants*)

**2. Exit Ticket:**
*   Distribute small slips of paper.
*   Write the following prompt on the board: **"Based on today's lesson, explain in 2-3 sentences why a farmer would plant leguminous plants in a field to help the next crop grow better. Use at least one specific fact from our list."**

*(Expected answer should mention that microorganisms/bacteria in the root nodules of leguminous plants fix nitrogen from the air and add it to the soil, which increases soil fertility for the next plants.)*
