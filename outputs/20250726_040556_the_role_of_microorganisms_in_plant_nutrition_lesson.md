### **Lesson Plan**

---

**1. Topic**
The Role of Microorganisms in Plant Nutrition

**2. Target Grades**
5th and 8th Grade (with differentiated activities)

**3. Objectives**
Upon completion of this lesson, students will be able to:
*   Identify that some microorganisms are beneficial for plant growth.
*   Explain that certain bacteria and blue-green algae fix atmospheric nitrogen, converting it into compounds usable by plants.
*   Describe the location of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the root nodules of leguminous plants.
*   Understand that microorganisms like bacteria and fungi decompose organic waste, returning nitrogenous compounds to the soil.
*   Outline the basic components of the nitrogen cycle as described in the source material.

**4. Materials**
*   Copies of the provided primary source material for students.
*   Whiteboard or projector.
*   Markers or pens.
*   Drawing paper.
*   Colored pencils or crayons.
*   Images: Fig. 2.9 (Roots of a leguminous plant with root nodules) and Fig. 2.10 (Nitrogen cycle).
*   (Optional) A small amount of milk and starter curd (dahi/yogurt) for the introductory analogy.

**5. Introduction (10 minutes)**
*   **Analogy Demonstration:** The instructor will present the analogy: "Microorganisms in the soil are like the small spoonful of starter curd we add to warm milk to make fresh dahi. Just as the starter turns milk into nutritious dahi, these tiny organisms convert complex soil nutrients into a simple form that plants can easily absorb for their growth."
*   **Connecting to Plants:** Pose the question: "If plants get water and sunlight, what else do they need from the soil to grow strong?"
*   **Introducing the Topic:** State that today's lesson will focus on invisible helpers in the soil—microorganisms—and their critical role in feeding plants. Explain that just like the starter curd, these microorganisms change something unusable (nitrogen in the air) into something usable for the plant.

**6. Activities (25 minutes)**

*   **Part A: Guided Reading and Fact-Finding (10 minutes)**
    *   Distribute the primary source material.
    *   Students will read the excerpts, highlighting or underlining facts related to how microorganisms help plants.
    *   The instructor will lead a brief discussion, asking students to share the facts they found. Key points to elicit from the text:
        *   Some microorganisms live in the root nodules of leguminous plants (*Rhizobium*).
        *   They fix nitrogen from the air into the soil, increasing fertility.
        *   Certain bacteria and blue-green algae in the soil also fix nitrogen from the atmosphere.
        *   Plants use these nitrogen compounds to synthesize proteins.
        *   When plants and animals die, bacteria and fungi decompose them, converting nitrogenous wastes back into usable compounds for plants.

*   **Part B: Visual Analysis (5 minutes)**
    *   Project or display Fig. 2.9 (Root Nodules) and Fig. 2.10 (Nitrogen Cycle).
    *   **Differentiation for Grade 5:** Focus on Fig. 2.9. Ask students: "Based on the text, what are these bumps on the roots called? What important job are the microorganisms inside them doing?"
    *   **Differentiation for Grade 8:** Focus on Fig. 2.10. Ask students to trace the path of nitrogen using the diagram and the text. Ask: "According to the diagram and text, what are the two main ways nitrogen gets from the atmosphere into a usable form for plants? What are two ways it returns to the atmosphere or the soil?"

*   **Part C: Concept Drawing (10 minutes)**
    *   **Differentiation for Grade 5:** Students will draw a large plant with roots in the soil. They must draw and label the root nodules and write one or two sentences explaining their function based on the text (e.g., "Bacteria in the root nodules take nitrogen from the air and give it to the plant.").
    *   **Differentiation for Grade 8:** Students will create their own labeled diagram of the nitrogen cycle. The diagram must include and label the following processes based on the source material:
        1.  Atmospheric Nitrogen
        2.  Nitrogen fixation by bacteria and blue-green algae.
        3.  Conversion to nitrogenous compounds in the soil.
        4.  Uptake by plant roots.
        5.  Decomposition of dead plants/animals by bacteria and fungi.
        6.  Conversion of nitrogen compounds back into nitrogen gas by certain bacteria.

**7. Assessment (10 minutes)**
Students will complete a brief written exit ticket to assess their understanding of the key concepts.

*   **Questions for Grade 5:**
    1.  List one way microorganisms are helpful to plants.
    2.  Where can you find the bacteria *Rhizobium* on a leguminous plant?
    3.  What do these bacteria do for the plant?

*   **Questions for Grade 8:**
    1.  Explain the process of nitrogen fixation as described in the text.
    2.  Describe the role of bacteria and fungi in decomposition and its benefit to living plants.
    3.  According to the text, how is nitrogen gas returned to the atmosphere from the soil?
    4.  Why does the percentage of nitrogen in the atmosphere remain "more or less constant"?
