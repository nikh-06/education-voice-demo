### **Answer Key**

**Part 1**

1.  **microorganisms** (Source: Page 16, "However, there are other living organisms around us which we normally cannot see. These are called microorganisms or microbes.")
2.  **Lactobacillus** (Source: Page 18, "Of these, the bacterium , Lactobacillus promotes the formation of curd.")

**Part 2**

3.  **d) All of the above** (Source: Pages 27 and 30 mention all these locations. Page 27: "Microorganisms are found in air, water and in the bodies of plants and animals." Page 30: "They have been found living in boiling mudpots and extremly cold icy waters." and "A kind of bacterium was recovered from a camera which stood on the moon for two years.")
4.  **Beneficial/Friend:** They are used in the preparation of curd, bread, cake, or alcohol. (Source: Page 18, "They are used in the preparation of curd, bread and cake." and "Microorganisms have been used for the production of alcohol since ages.")
    **Harmful/Foe:** They cause diseases. (Source: Page 18, "...some others are harmful and cause diseases.")
5.  **Explanation:** Being "hardy" means they can live under extreme conditions. (Source: Page 30, "They are such hardy organisms that they can live under extreme conditions.")
    **Two Examples (any two of the following are correct):**
    *   Boiling mudpots
    *   Extremely cold icy waters
    *   Lakes of caustic soda
    *   Pools of concentrated sulphuric acid
    *   At depths of several kilometres
    *   In space / on a camera on the moon
