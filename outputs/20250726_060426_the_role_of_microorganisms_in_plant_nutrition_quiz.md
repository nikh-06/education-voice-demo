### **Answer Key**

1.  **According to the text, plants cannot use nitrogen directly from the atmosphere. What do certain bacteria and blue-green algae do to make nitrogen usable for plants, and how do plants then absorb it?**
    
    Certain bacteria and blue-green algae fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into compounds of nitrogen. Plants can then utilize these usable compounds by absorbing them from the soil through their root system.
    
2.  **The text mentions a specific relationship between some bacteria and leguminous plants.**
    
    **a) What is the name of the bacteria that lives in the root nodules of these plants?**
    The text names the bacteria as *Rhizobium*.
    
    **b) What is the main function of these bacteria that helps increase soil fertility?**
    Their main function is to fix nitrogen from the air into the soil, which increases soil fertility.
    
3.  **When plants and animals die, they become organic waste. Explain the role of bacteria and fungi in this situation and how their actions help living plants.**
    
    When plants and animals die, bacteria and fungi in the soil decompose the organic waste. They convert the nitrogenous wastes from the dead bodies into nitrogenous compounds that can be used again by living plants.
