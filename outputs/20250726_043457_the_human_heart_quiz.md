### **Answer Key**

#### **Part 1 Answers**

1.  The purpose is to protect our flora (plants) and fauna (animals) and their habitats.
2.  The objective of "Project Tiger" was to protect tigers and ensure the survival and maintenance of the tiger population in the country.

#### **Part 2 Answers**

1.  In a wildlife sanctuary, animals live in their natural habitat and are protected from disturbances. An "artificial setting" is not an animal's natural home. The text explains that animals are more "comfortable and happy in their own habitat."
2.  The Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve is considered part of our national heritage because of its "unique" biodiversity, containing plants and animals similar to those found in both the upper Himalayan peaks and the lower western ghats. Preserving areas of such "biological importance" makes them part of our national heritage.
3.  Hunting is now prohibited because the goal of modern protected areas is to "protect our flora and fauna and their habitats." Activities like hunting are a disturbance to the animals and go against the objective of ensuring the "survival and maintenance" of animal populations.
