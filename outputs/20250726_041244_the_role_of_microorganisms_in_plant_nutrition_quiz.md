# The Role of Microorganisms in Plant Nutrition

### Part 1 (5th Grade Level)

*Instructions: Answer the following questions based on the source material.*

1.  According to the text, where do the *Rhizobium* bacteria that help leguminous plants live?
2.  What do some bacteria and blue green algae in the soil do to nitrogen from the atmosphere so that plants can use it?

### Part 2 (8th Grade Level)

*Instructions: Answer the following questions using detailed explanations based on the source material.*

1.  The text describes two roles for microorganisms: decomposing dead organisms and converting nitrogenous wastes into compounds plants can use. Explain how these two processes are linked in providing nutrients to living plants.
2.  Describe the complete process, in order, of how nitrogen from the atmosphere becomes part of a plant's proteins.
3.  The text mentions that some bacteria add nitrogen compounds to the soil, while certain other bacteria release nitrogen gas back into the atmosphere. What is the stated overall result of these two opposing processes?

### Answer Key

**Part 1**
1.  They are present in the nodules of roots of leguminous plants.
2.  They fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into compounds of nitrogen that can be utilised by plants from the soil.

**Part 2**
1.  When plants and animals die, bacteria and fungi decompose them. This process converts the nitrogenous wastes in the dead organisms into nitrogenous compounds in the soil, which living plants can then use again for nutrition.
2.  First, certain bacteria and blue green algae in the soil fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into usable compounds. Next, plants utilize these compounds by absorbing them from the soil through their root system. Finally, the plant uses the nitrogen to synthesize plant proteins and other compounds.
3.  The overall result is that the percentage of nitrogen in the atmosphere remains more or less constant.
