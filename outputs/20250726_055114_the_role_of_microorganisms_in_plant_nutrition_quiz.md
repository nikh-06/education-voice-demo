### **Worksheet: Microorganisms and Plant Nutrition**

**Name:** _________________________
**Date:** _________________________

**Instructions:** Read the questions below carefully. Use only the provided source information to write your answers in complete sentences.

---

**1.** The atmosphere is full of nitrogen, but plants cannot use it directly from the air. Explain the process that certain microorganisms use to make this atmospheric nitrogen available for plants.

---

**2.** Describe the specific relationship between microorganisms and leguminous plants. Where are these microorganisms found, and how do they affect the soil?

---

**3.** What is the role of bacteria and fungi when plants and animals die? How does this process help living plants?

***

### **Answer Key**

**1.** Certain bacteria and blue-green algae in the soil "fix" nitrogen from the atmosphere. They convert the nitrogen gas into usable nitrogenous compounds. Plants can then absorb these compounds from the soil through their root system.

**2.** Some microorganisms reside in the root nodules of leguminous plants. From there, they fix nitrogen from the air into the soil. This process increases the soil's fertility.

**3.** When plants and animals die, bacteria and fungi in the soil decompose the dead organic waste. They convert the nitrogenous wastes into nitrogenous compounds that can be used by living plants again, providing them with essential nutrients.
