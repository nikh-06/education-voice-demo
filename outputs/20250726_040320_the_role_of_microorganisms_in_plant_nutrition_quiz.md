# The Role of Microorganisms in Plant Nutrition

### **Part 1 (Suggested for 5th Grade)**

*Instructions: Answer the following questions using only the information provided in the source material.*

1.  According to the text, where do some microorganisms that fix nitrogen live on leguminous plants?

2.  How do certain bacteria that live in the soil make it more fertile for plants?

### **Part 2 (Suggested for 8th Grade)**

*Instructions: Answer the following questions using only the information provided in the source material. Your answers should be detailed and comprehensive.*

1.  Explain why plants cannot use nitrogen directly from the atmosphere and how microorganisms solve this problem for them.

2.  The text describes a complete cycle for nitrogen. Describe the three distinct roles that different types of bacteria play in this cycle.

3.  Besides fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere, describe another essential role microorganisms play in making nutrients available for plants in the soil.

### **Answer Key**

**Part 1**

1.  They live in the root nodules of leguminous plants.
2.  They fix nitrogen from the air into the soil and convert it into nitrogenous compounds, which increases soil fertility.

**Part 2**

1.  Plants and animals cannot take nitrogen directly from the atmosphere. Certain bacteria and blue-green algae present in the soil fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into usable compounds of nitrogen. Plants can then utilize these compounds from the soil through their root system.
2.  First, certain bacteria fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into nitrogenous compounds for plants to use. Second, when plants and animals die, bacteria and fungi convert the nitrogenous wastes back into nitrogenous compounds that can be used by plants again. Third, certain other bacteria convert compounds of nitrogen present in the soil back into nitrogen gas, which is released into the atmosphere.
3.  Some microorganisms decompose organic waste and dead plants and animals. This process converts their nitrogenous wastes into simple, nitrogenous compounds that can be used by plants again.
